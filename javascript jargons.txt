Javascript terms:

1)Pure functions: a function that is expected to give exact result as the input. 
this means won't take any external variables which can affect the result returned by the function.

2)Side effects: change in result caused by change in an external variable in a function.

3)Impure function: anything which is not a pure function is an impure function.

4)Array destructuring:  [a,b]=[10,20], a=10,b=20.

5)Object destructuring: const{shape}=shapeObj, where shapeObj={shape:'rectangle'} and now shape=rectangle
